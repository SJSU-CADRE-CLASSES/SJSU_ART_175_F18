# FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL: CoDraw Pannel
Xiao Wu & Yi Liu
--------------------------

Our project for the final is a collaboration drawing board. Basically, it is a web-based drawing canvas that can be shared on different screens. The concept of this project is to let people collaborating on the same project from a certain distance and experience the unique sensation. In project 2, we made a similar piece while it could only work on the local server. This time we have put it onto the cloud, which means everyone can access the canvas from his or her laptop and cell phone while the server is up. Although the idea sounds very simple, there was a quite complex process to reach it. What we did is to hold a server for the data exchanging. Each user will upload their mouse data whenever they have progress on the canvas. Meanwhile, the server will transfer the data it received to the other users who have connected to the server and make the same drawing on their side. As a result, everyone has a synchronous canvas on his or her screen and therefore able to build his or her idea on the same canvas. In the latter paragraph, we would like to introduce some of our experience to realize the project.

The first thing we have to do is to set up the server. We use node.js, which is a cross-platform Javascript, to write a code that can hold a server and can be executed with ‘command’ on Windows or ‘terminal’ on Apple. The server was responsible for being a host and giving each user an ID which used for data exchanging. We still make it at local at the very beginning because it is easy for test and editing. But in the latter part of this project, we put it on to another server so that everyone who has internet can access it; as simple as browsing a website. 
The second step is to build a way for each port to exchanging data. The solution is called socket.io. It is a library that allows server and web client to communicate with each other. We wrote it into both server and web client code. By doing that, one user’s movement will be recorded and transfer to the server, and the server will tell other clients what that user did and let them repeat the process.
When everything running smoothly at local, it is time to put them onto the internet. We use Amazon Web Server to realize this step. Different from other hosting services, AWS’ EC2 service allows the user to install things remotely, which means we can install node.js and socket.io over that side. After installing, we did the process from the local to set up the server and uploaded necessary files to AWS, as well as changed the IP address that the web client going to point at. 
The final thing we did for the project is the UI improvement. Despite the title name, and makers’ names, we also briefly introducing how to use this website.  We display this information on the top-right corner of the website view. The canvas is shown after drawers click on the website link, or import the website address. And can be cleaned completely after it gets freshed. As drawers open multiple websites they will experience the different stage of the drawing. So we decide to make a “OPEN IN DIFFERENT TAG” link on the left. 

Of course, there are many difficulties we have experienced in this project. The hardest work is to transfer the project from local to AWS. First, there are many security-related problems that preventing you to connect to AWS, as well as the way to solve it is quite different between Windows user and Mac User. Meanwhile, we also spend a long time on troubleshooting when the client stops talking to each other after uploading to AWS. We finally found the IP address that the client pointed has to be the AWS’ while the server has to keep the local IP address. The project finally works successfully and have been presented to the class. We have a lot of fun while presenting, not only collaborate to make a draw, but also destroying others’ piece. After all, it was a great experience to achieve our goal. 
In the future, we might develop more experience on the website. Maybe more colors among different players, maybe bigger canvas, maybe output or save the canvas. Maybe more. We really like this project and really have fun. We hope people can enjoy making a unique masterpiece through the internet cooperation with their friends.
