Sebastian Schmieg is a net artist who explores our relationship with technology. While many of us tend to think these forms are extensions of ourselves, Schmieg brings up an interesting and alternate point : We as digital workers are the software extensions. In terms of Artificial Intelligence, we are presented with certain curriculum to respond to in order to help AI develop. What does this mean exactly? Schmieg says that “Being a software extension means that you are extending a computational system by offering your body, your sense, of your cognition…Everybody has to be as efficient and valuable a node in this network they can be.” Human efficiency must rise as extentions’ utilities are easily removed and discarded. This is due to online platforms, widening the playing field in the digital labor market. This digital labor can range from developing software to working with Google’s reCaptcha system. Using Captcha as our example, we are helping websites fight against external bots and spam. According to Google’s, “…reCAPTCHA makes positive use of this human effort by channeling the time spent solving CAPTCHAs into digitising text, annotating images, and building machine learning datasets. This in turn helps preserve books, improve maps, and solve hard AI problems.” Yet by doing this, aren’t we also helping these external threats develop their learning capabilities as well? We are helping train these neural networks, but for free.
