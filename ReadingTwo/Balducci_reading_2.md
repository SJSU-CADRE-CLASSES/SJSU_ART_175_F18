Pretend of be a bot, dehumanizing the web is a unique look at how bots and humans are interacting through a purposed system. Sebastian Schmieg explains the different dynamics and relationships of humans and online bots, one particularly interesting use of bots in the human world was the Trump presidential campaign which labored humans who used bots for the promotional labor. Its clear that social media impact with humans have a dramatic effect, it also has a profound effect on labor and cost of labor as it makes communications easier and apps like Fiverr undercut the market for these simple labor tasks. Through the existence of these applications, we generate more work for both humans and machines. I agree that we are extensions of ourselves through software, working collectively with all systems together. I found it interesting that Schmieg thought machines and bots wonâ€™t be able to be artists but they can create art, even though the output potential remains unknown.

This reading gave me an idea about how I can create my own bot, that is free for public service. This bought will be for my next project that provides a service to anyone who reaches out to me. This concept and reading gave me ideas that would be ideal to demonstrate how helpful tools can be used for the public for free. The only person at work would be me, while the bot tells me which tasks I need to complete. Schmiegs breakdown of the relationships made me realize how I can play a role within this world.
