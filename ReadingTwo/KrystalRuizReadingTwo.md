I think Schmieg makes a very good point. It’s really an interesting idea that people might be contributing to their
own dehumanization by taking part in the digital work force to the point that they essentially become a machine, themselves. 
I definitely think this is a very real thing as I’ve seen forms of this “dehumanization of the web” as humans take on the roles 
of unfeeling machines or “bots” for the benefit of big companies. While this may not be entirely the same, as an avid Youtube 
user, whether I have something like Adblock enabled or not, I’m constantly being exposed to and bombarded by basically 
walking-talking advertisements. To be more specific, many famous beauty youtubers or bloggers on said platform will take on 
sponsorships and become affiliates with beauty and makeup brands. These influencers are most often given scripts or guidelines 
to follow while talking about a company’s product that strip away almost any or all individual thought or feelings. In this sense,
many viewers like myself tend to feel a strong disconnect with influencers during these moments because its often seen as robotic, 
greedy and akin to an automated message before every video rather than a sincere recommendation for their audience. These influencers
have to be just personable enough to attract viewers but at the same time, have to seem a little less than human and unfeeling in order 
to sell a product using this method. They’re given pre-written opinions about the product and often other competing products in addition
to the pre-written answers to viewer questions that have little to do with their own personal experiences with the product they’re trying
to sell. 
Regarding Shmieg’s comments about social network companies paying its users, I would say this makes sense for companies to do so for
specific users that have some sort of higher social standing on the platform. Beauty influencers are also an example of a big company
like Youtube, which is owned by Google, paying its users or influencers for using its social network in order to make a profit for them 
as their presence brings more and more people and revenue to their website. Rather than being considered official employees, however, 
they’re seen and treated more as independent contractors.
Overall, I have an inkling that our society’s growing reliance on technology and digital workers for the sake of getting things done
quickly and efficiently will only worsen over time.
