The project we worked on incorperates intagram to convey the topic; user prvacy on social media. The work itself is a platform to voice people's opinions of how social media companies access and use the data of it's users. In the project we also created a starting list of rights these companies should follow. This subject is a very relative and important matter in this day and age, with companies like Google and Facebook encompassing most of our lives online. Other users can come in and contribute/add more to the list or give their feedback on this subject.
