Final Project: Duckling, 2018

Project description:
How people present themselves to others in reality can greatly differ from how they present themselves on social media sites. Because the internet lacks the pressure of talking to another person face-to-face, people tend to be more active online while being more private in their personal lives. For our project we used images from Twitter to tell the story of a single person's life online. The figure itself looks calm, but the images used to show their online life are opposite and display the various struggles that they're facing with others on the site.
