The goal of this assignment was to research and bring to light how fake news has been permeating our online experience for the past few years. I found 10 articles and randomly arranged them in an array for viewers to determine whether or not they are fake, some obvious, some not. Once a button is pressed, a narrative displays, telling the user about the dangers of fake news from various sources.
