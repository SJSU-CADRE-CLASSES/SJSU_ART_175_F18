<p> I was inspired by the first science book that my father bought me when I was 7 years old, which is generally talking about the outer space. I remember the cover shows the entire solar system with these “funny” tracks. Yes, with tracks. It was even more interesting that I didn’t even know there is no actual track at all in a real outer space until I got 20. This is not a joke, and I was trying to satirize in this project that a lot of time we are “tricked” by wrong information.</p>
