My project is meant as a statement on the futility of escaping media in the modern age. The user is placed in a 3d room surrounded by tvs only displaying static, with harsh lighting. One can actually escape the room by walking through the walls, but much like with media in reality even if you place distance between you and it, it will remain there in the distance, inescapable.
