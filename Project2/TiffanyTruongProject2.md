So with the second project, I wanted to convey how companies collect data of people who use their products without their knowledge. My original plan was to create a scene in ThreeJS showing a greenhouse in a meadow. As soon as the viewer opened the page (and as they continue moving around the model), a Twitter bot would be tweeting out their mouse location and their overall movements. The reason why I chose to create a 3D model of a greenhouse as the thing being observed while a person's activities are being publicized is because peoples' data are like the plants in the building: they are collected and logged without being moved / used until necessary. The greenhouse owners and the companies have complete control over what they do with their products/data.

But this obviously didn't happen.

I couldn't get the Twitter bot to work, so I found a code that allowed for similar information to be collected through HTML and Javascript through clicking buttons. I wasn't able to finish the project (hence why I only have screenshots of the two separate parts I showed during class presentations), but <b>I <i>will</i> finish it</b> as a personal project.
