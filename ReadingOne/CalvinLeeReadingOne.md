' A CYBERFEMINIST MANIFESTO FOR THE 21ST CENTURY '

 Cyberfeminist Manifesto by VNS MATRIX (Josephine Starrs, Julianne Pierce, Francesca Da Rimini, and Virginia Baratt is a project of series of multiple media about the collision of cyberfeminism and its interrelationship with the development of technology. The artworks by VNS Matrix frequently use the cunt metaphor which frees women from slut-shaming, stereotypes of women and the "duty" of women. Considering the theory that the development of technology leads to the collapse of the hegemony of men due to the fewer requirements of the workforce, it is indubitable that cyberfeminism is a crucial medium to empower women. 
 The Internet is an anonymous place where misogynistic language is all over. looking into just twitter and youtube comment section,
 it is easy to find people who attack women without reasons. It is very important to bring cyberfeminism and raise women's voice to bring awareness to this in cyberspace.

' NINE EYES OF GOOGLE STREET VIEW '

  Nine Eyes of Google Street View by Jon Rafman is an archival project which reframed the collection of footages from Google Street View into a series of conceptual photography art. The screenshots that Rafman gathered contain images that can be found in our daily life, 
  but he created a series to bring out awareness for social justice in the disparaging neighborhood which is not portrayed in the mainstream media. 
  Nine Eyes of Google Street View is controversial when it comes to categorizing it as an art piece because Rafman did not capture the moment himself.
  However, I consider it as an art piece because even though anyone can have access to the Google Street Views, the footages can't be found easily and Rafman gathered them to give meanings. I believe that it's almost impossible to create "Original" web art in the 21st century due to the overflow of arts and artists. However, Rafman's creativity created a new meaning to the photography that already existed before and I would consider it as an art piece.
