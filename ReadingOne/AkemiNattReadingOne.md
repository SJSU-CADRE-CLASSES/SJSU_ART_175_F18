Female Extension by Cornelia Sollfrank (DE) is a cyberfeminist net art piece whose statement is just as relevant now as it was then. The first question that came to mind when reviewing this work is, “Of the stated ‘esteemed jury,’ how many of these individuals were women? If any?”  Even if there were some women on this esteemed board, was their input be valued lower than their male peers? Thus, their presence equates not to making a difference in the competition’s outcome but merely false representation. Eventually referring to the current project website  (http://artwarez.org/femext/index.html) two of the five judges were in fact women (Christiane Dellbrügge and Professor Valie Export) . Yet even with these two females on the jury, along with the two-thirds of “female applicants,” all recognition was awarded to male artists. Why?

Grobari by Aleksandra Domanović is another interesting net art piece that does not appear fitting upon first take. It is represented as a physical sculpture that creates an image depicting “plumes of smoke from flares set off by an organized group of extremist football fans.” This piece, composed of thousands of carefully stacked pdf files is a response to the .yu domain name. This domain name has since expired (2010). I think it’s beautiful that the loss of Yugoslavia’s virtual identity remains in the physical space.
