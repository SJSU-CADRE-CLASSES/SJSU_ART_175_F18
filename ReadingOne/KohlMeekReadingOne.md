  The first of the long list of pieces that got my attention was Constant Dullaart’s 2010 creation “The Revolving Internet.
Two qualities I rather enjoy in any piece of art are simplicity and humor, and this piece has both in spades. All it does is take whatever 
website you are currently trying to use and make it spin forever. The pure absurdity of trying to actually do anything on it is 
pretty goofy and This feeling is only enhanced when one notices “Windmills in my Mind” playing in the background. It seems the 
creator was attempting to get people to consider the ever growing power and influence that platforms like google have. For me this 
isn’t exactly successful. However, it does make me appreciate the most basic standards of user interface that we all take for granted. 
This piece shows that when something forgoes these principles it’s a little galling.

  A second one that caught my eye was Miao Ying’s 2007 piece “Blind Spot”. It addresses the question brought up during class of what a
net art piece might look like that wasn’t actually in any way part of the internet, or even electronic. Much like “The Revolving Internet”
it’s a very simple concept. Ying searched every word in a Chinese dictionary and whited out any words censored in China at the time.
For me the change in perspective that comes from this small transition from censorship online to censorship in a book highlights how
tragic depriving people of information is. It’s the physicality it attains. It changes the censorship from an area in a cloud of ones
and zeros that one can’t access, to a real thing with weight. Something one can hold in their hands. Alas it has been over a decade
since this piece's creation and censorship in China seems to be as strong if not stronger than ever.

	Finally I was spent some time looking at Cao Fei’s second life creation “RMB City”. While, I don’t find the actual look and
  aesthetics of the city, I am intrigued by the experimental nature of what it represented, an avante-garde virtual community. I’ve
  always wondered by som much of user created content in things like second life mirror reality, and it would seem Fei had the same
  question. The whole place is an abstracted depiction of china during a state of economic decline. Yet despite all the abstraction
  it is still somehow recognisable as a city. RMB City, it seems, was meant to be set right at the crossroads of reality and the
  virtual, or as their manifesto says “ Let all the virtual-real conflicts vanish in RMB City”.
