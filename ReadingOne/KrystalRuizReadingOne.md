The first piece that caught my attention was The Dollie Clone Series by Lynn Hershman Leeson. I thought her use of technology
or robotics to allow for an interactive experience for the viewer was rather unique for its time. I also really liked the idea 
of using webcams to function as her dolls eyes, and the idea that the “evil” twin doll, which also represented her alter ego, 
was considered so because of her ability to steal the other doll’s video feed. Even if not entirely intentional, it brings up 
an interesting discussion and perspective about how surveillance culture and specifically how a lack of true privacy in many 
public areas affects the way we live our lives and how people might tend to see this as a more negative but inevitable side 
effect of our growing fascination and dependency on technology.

The second piece that peaked my interest was LOVE by Group Z, Belgium or Michaël Samyn and his nine other artistic alter egos. 
I liked the decision to show all different experiences and aspects of romantic love, whether it be about the more innocent or 
perverted parts, or even the cynical feelings that follow after the loss of love. I felt that the rawness of his piece created 
a more intimate and relatable atmosphere while navigating through the site and while experiencing each story. I also appreciated 
the flexibility of the narrative as it seems more or less dependent on the user’s whim while navigating through the site in a 
nonlinear path. Overall, it just seemed like a very real, intimate and emotional piece that I could see alot of people relating to.
