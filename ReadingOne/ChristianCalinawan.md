Nine Eyes of Google Street View by Jon Rafman is a collection of screenshots taken from Google Street View. I think this is a very 
interesting project for several reasons. The images Google Street View captured are unique. These pictures were not taken to capture 
a certain mood or theme. The sole purpose of Google Street View was to document and tale a snapshot of the streets of the world for 
the world to see and explore. However, Rafman collected certain snapshots and repurposed them for his own project. He carefully selected
the photographs with the most interesting contents and compositions. Without any prior context or knowledge of this project, one could 
assume these images are just regular photographs, although they were just taken on the road by Google Street View. I find it amazing that
all these photos were taken by a small camera on top of a car whose intention was to simply document the roads. Instead, it took images 
that could pass as photos intentionally taken by a human. Some of these photos are so good looking that I find it hard to believe they 
were taken on the road by Google Street View. 

Overall, I think there’s a wide variety of interesting scenarios captured in these images. His selected images capture interesting and 
strange human interactions, especially in more run-down cities and areas. He also selected a ton of images displaying beautiful landscapes
and nature, as well as a lot of wild animals. Some images also seem to be taken from Google Street View on feet. One image stands out as 
it depicts a killer whale jumping out of a pool of water at a Seaworld-like area, with a large crowd seated around the pool. I don’t see 
a car having access to this kind of photograph, so a human must have taken the camera on foot. My only complaint is that Rafman did not 
include coordinates below each photograph. I think it would be a lot more interesting if the audience had the option to go into Google 
Street View and view the images ourselves straight from the software. A reason why I think Rafman didn’t include coordinates is because 
the image could be updated on the site, conflicting with the previous image he chose. But I still think it could be interesting to compare.

I believe that the artist in this collection is a mix between Google and Rafman. Although Google originally took these photographs, they 
did so without the intention of calling them art. Rafman, on the other hand, carefully hand-picked each image for his project. The project
could not exist without either parties. Rafman needed Google to take the photographs for him, and Rafman was needed to select each 
specific image.
