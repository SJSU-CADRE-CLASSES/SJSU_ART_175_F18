As I was reading this article, I was trying to figure out what my own rendition of the term postinternet would look like. The author described his breakdown of what the post internet term could mean or how it could be defined. The artists involvement within the new media scene is an exploration into organizing and defining the line between utopia and dystopia, practicing art through technology. Post internet architecture involves social context that is oftenly overlooked, and the technology we use has become singular. Most of what we do through technology has become part of what we chose to do with it, and the different meta spaces we adapted to because of these technologies.  It was interesting to read about a future where things are just copied onto of another. Being constantly plugged to the internet and being familiar with so many things inside and outside of the internet creates a line to draw on what exactly postinternet would look like.
