Marisa Olsen’s “On the internet, no one knows you’re a doghouse”, is a compelling article that addresses the “post-internet” phenomenon. The author expresses some frustration over how post-internet art has yet to be defined. A quote from the article that I really liked is how other critics that she’s work with all mentioned that the fact that new media was not really new anymore and the novelty has worn off. The author also talks about how using technology to make art is put on the back burner and in a way looked down upon despite the general public using technology and the internet for about everything else. This also relates to the social context of the post-internet movement and the idea of being unable to unplug. This issue of not being able to unplug and it’s expectation to fix our emotional problems are very problematic. Not being able to decipher between offline and online worlds can cause even more problems in our personal lives. The author does a great job at relating this to privacy and the boundaries of our lives and the internet.  Olsen gives a very authentic perspective and opinion of the post-internet movement and how it relates to how technology affects us all today.
