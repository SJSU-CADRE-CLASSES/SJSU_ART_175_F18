  The article ‘On the Internet, No One Knows You're a Doghouse’ written by Marisa Olson basically introduced the idea of postinternet and how people creating art under the special era we are currently experiencing. To be honest, the reading is kind confused to me. According to the author, the word ‘postinternet’ is used to describe the time and phenomenon we have today, which the internet world is closely bound up with the real world and affect to each other at the same time. Meanwhile, The author also said it could be any word. My understanding is the word ‘postinternet’ doesn’t state the true condition of the era we are experiencing. It is because the development of the internet is still in progress. Although it is very different from what we have before, it is not exactly to describe it as a ‘post age’ while the age is not in the past. In other words, there are still possibilities can be founded. In the second half of the article, the author stated that we should not persist in the frameworks we currently have because it will limit our creativity. She encourage people to understand and learn from the current age but at same time ‘against’ what we have, because “This is where we meet fantasy and look back to the future”. I think the purpose of this article is to remind people the current ‘postinternet’ time and encourage us to change it at the same time, which is like a recall of renaissance.
