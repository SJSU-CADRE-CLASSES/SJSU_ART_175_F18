In her article, On The Internet, No One Knows You’re A Doghouse,” artist Marisa Olson writes about the concepts of postinternet cities 
and architecture. Initially, Olson used these terms to describe her own artwork and believes she started a controversial movement or 
coined those terms. She also states she constantly reads that postinternet art has yet to be defined. She then defines it as describing
her own work, artwork made online and offline. It is the style of the internet, celebrating it and critiquing it. 

After reading Olson’s description of postinternet, it is still a difficult concept to grasp. Does the term postinternet apply to anything
made with a theme related to the internet?  I am not exactly sure what differentiates this from net art. She states we know what it is, 
what it looks like, and what its aesthetics are about and that we see it everywhere, yet I don’t feel like I can identify something I see
as postinternet art.
