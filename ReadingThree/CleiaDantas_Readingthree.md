Reading Three: On the Internet, No One Knows You're a Doghouse by Marisa Olson
****

The author is clearly upset for being one of the first to follow the internet trend. As stated in the readings, she has been part of the scene since the 90s and has been influenced by the greatest curators and critics.

She says that her interest lies on the way we share information across social networks and writes about what postinternet means based on her expertise and experience.

She is certainly right about our necessity to be connected at all times. The advances in internet services all over the globe have allowed people free access to almost anything they want.  From the click of a mouse or by the push of a button, people have access to an almost infinite amount of information, therefore we don’t want to log off.

Face to face conversations appears to be boring, why spending time talking to someone if you can talk to many people at once on internet chats? Not to mention the ability to search for images and videos or references in case online conversations become too intellectual and references are needed to back up a point.

The city of the future will probably have a singularity in mind, we shall aim for a utopian society such as imagined by writers. However, I’m not sure that everyone would accept nor fit into such a society. Even though technology has advanced and spread in many layers in our society, I still feel as if only a small percentage of people are really taking advantage of its potential. As for the title of the reading, I wanted to mention it couldn’t have been more appropriate.
