<p>In the article "On the Internet, No One Knows You're a Doghouse", Marisa Olson talked about the word “postinternet” as a kind of critique. One thing that I found interesting is she said “it seemed radical to propose that a painter, photographer, or textile artist could be an internet artist and that these underdogs could use our support.” I can tell that she is not satisfied about this, even angry. She wants to prove herself and she wants the word “post internet” to be defined. The other thing that in my mind after I read this article is that she said new media is not new anymore. I think it is because that many things has been distributed by computers and internet. Also, she is not happy with the result of internet advanced that tend to bring us to dystopia society. Well, we hope that an utopia is in our future world, but in my experience is that we are swallowed by internet: as the article said we are isolating ourselves due to the social internet. We cannot live without social networks, and most information that we know is from that. The original purpose of the advance is more far away, and the things will develop in the opposite side when they become extreme. I think it is the phenomenon now, and we are stucked in what internet brings us.</p>
