I found it interesting how the author discussed the uncertainty of the word “postinternet” and its purpose. I’ve heard the word be mentioned before, but never had a solid idea of what it truly meant. She talks about how the word and its movement has a social context to it where our connections are networked to each other through technology. It’s seems like we’re “unable to unplug” from the internet because of how prevalent it is in our society. Even when we aren’t using any sort of device the online world is still shown to us in the form of merchandise or some other sort of item referencing apps like Tumblr, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. I was also interested in how the author talks about how this advancement of technology may be causing us to head towards a dystopian society. She paints the image of numerous buildings copied and pasted on top of each other to reach heights high enough to accommodate our growing population with factories producing more technology and polluting our skies. While I do see some aspects of how the line between online and offline seem to blur, I’m still uncertain of whether or not this is true. It’s hard to determine how exactly we will advance in the future or if we will advance that much at all.
