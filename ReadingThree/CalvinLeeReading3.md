  The article, "On the internet, No One Knows You're a Doghouse" by Marisa Olson discusses the background of the term "Postinternet"
  and its impact on modern life and art. The emergence of the internet impacted a huge part of modern human society from small parts to big parts.
  Olson mentions two ways she used the term "Postinernet". The first one is to describe her own work, which was a combination of art made 
  online and art made offline, and the second one is to engage the minority artists who use different mediums that are not frequently used.
  Postinternet art can be various things. It can be absurd architecture design, new media arts, or even vaporwave arts.
  
  The boundary of online art and offline art became vague as the internet became commonly used. As Olson mentions, we can find products that were originated from online such as emoji magnets and Yelp stickers. Our daily life is also affected by the internet too. Food delivery,
  GPS and even Uber made our life more convenient and accessible to more things. However, the emergence of internet caused the fear of unplugging which led to Fear of Missing Out and addiction to SNS. Olson also debunks some myths about "Postinternet" such as techno-apocalypse.
  
  
  Even after finishing the reading, I still had only vague ideas about Postinternet, so I did some research about the different interpretations of Postinternet. There are four different ways the term "Postinternt" is used. The first one refers to the new media arts that were created after the emergence of the World Wide Web. The second one is Marisa Olson's definition of Postinternet as she mentions in the article. 
  The thirst one is Guthrie Lonergan's explanation of Postinternet that's related to Internet aware. Internet-Aware is when the photograph of the work is more known than the original piece.
  The last one is Gene McHugh's reaction to the Postinternet which was that Postinernet art is art that oscillates with the culture. Art that accepts the mainstream culture and adapts to it which is similar to what Olson addressed.
