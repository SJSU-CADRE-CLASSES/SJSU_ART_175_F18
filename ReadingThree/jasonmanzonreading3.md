"On the internet, No One knows You're a Doghouse" by Maria Olson talks about what "postinternet cities" or "postinternet architecture" are and what it means to speak of them. Before technology was just primarily used to browse the web or do its primary function but as time past by, artists started to use technology to create art. Olsen stated that "one small overlooked aspect of the postinternet movement is its social context". We are slowly starting to see an increase in the little difference between offline and online due to the fact that the internet is so intertwined with our lives. An example of this would be seeing: Yelp stickers on rerstaraunts, social media logos, GPS, and even using these technologies such as twitter, instagram, and snapchat to create real-time posts. The word "postinternet" itself creates discussion on the situation of network conditions.
