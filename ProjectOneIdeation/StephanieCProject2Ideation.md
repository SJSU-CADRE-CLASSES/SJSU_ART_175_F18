For my project, I want to create a black and white 3d world that will explore the relationship humans have in our current society and the factors that contribute to this relationship. For example, because of how technology and the internet allows the mass sharing of different views and opinions, I wanted to visualize the turbulence in which we see evidently in terms of politics and general morals. This idea is mostly inspired by one of Friedrich Nietzsche's quotes, "If you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you," and I wanted to connect that duality into the project. The visual style would be inspired from the game Neverending Nightmares and I want to create a drawn 2D environment in a 3D world. The viewer would probably view this project by going thorugh a series of hallways similar to a gallery. However, I'm worried about the scale of this world and whether there would be issues in rendering and whatnot on a website.
