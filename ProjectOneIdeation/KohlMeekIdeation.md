For my projet I would like to create a scene of an empty city street in which a user has control, and can move, and look around. Directly behind the user there will always be a large camera hovering and following them, always out of view. The only way the user will know it's there is by standing beneath a light source and seeing the shadow it cast. This is meant as a statement about how we are under constant surveilance but very few of us often notice it, unless they really look for it.
