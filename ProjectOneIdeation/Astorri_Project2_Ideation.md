For project 2, I currently have two different ideas: the first being a parody of the microtransaction controversy plaguing the gaming industry at the moment. It would be a “game” where you have to press a button to make stuff happen on screen, either building something or performing a mundane task. Eventually you would run out of “resources” and be forced to either wait for spend a fake currency to advance your progress. The second idea I had was to create a sort of mind-space, an area where your thoughts collect, where gravity does not exist and there are no limits. There are two possibilities in terms of the content: the first being a trippy area where there is no sense to it, in order to experiment with how to move in a 3D environment. Another possible concept would be to make an “unfinished gallery” where the pieces are all incomplete because the artist kept moving on to other pieces. 

Apologies for the late submittal!
