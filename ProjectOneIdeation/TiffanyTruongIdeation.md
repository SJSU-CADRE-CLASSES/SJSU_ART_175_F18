Honestly, I haven't come up with a concrete idea for the project that I am satisfied with. An idea I have now is to create a space online
where visitors can have a look around the space in 360 degrees. The presented scene would show the remnants of a birthday party with balloons,
confetti, food scattered everywhere. However, some items glitch as you hover over them indicating that they're not real; the only things that are real are
the room and the computer. What I'm trying to convey is how some people seek social aspects/ comforts online rather than in person(which may due to a variety of reasons).
