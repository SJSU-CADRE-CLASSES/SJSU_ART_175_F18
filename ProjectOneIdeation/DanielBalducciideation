create a 3d audio player that plays either different sounds or noises or has multiples songs/noises to operate. The number of audio sources are not yet known but ideally at least two indepedent sources that potentially can play within their own Sound radius. There will be a 3d dimensional object that moves within a sound radius that triggers the start of audio. Speed and radius can be adjusted allowing for variances within sound, chance operations.
