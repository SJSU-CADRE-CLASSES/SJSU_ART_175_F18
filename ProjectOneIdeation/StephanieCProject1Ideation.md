For my project, I want to create a black and white 3d world that will explore the relationship humans have in our current society and the factors that contribute to this relationship. For example, because of how technology and the internet allows the mass sharing of different views and opinions, I wanted to visualize the turbulence in which we see evidently in terms of politics and morals. The visual style would be inspired from the game Neverending Nightmares and I want to 2D environment into a 3D world. The viewer would probably view this project by going thorugh a series of hallways similar to a gallery. However, I'm worried about the scale of this world and whether there would be issues in rendering and whatnot on a website.
