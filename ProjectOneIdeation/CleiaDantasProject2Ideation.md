Project 2: Ephemera/Multi-Representational
-----------------------------------------------
For this project, I want to challenge myself to explore the capabilities of WebGL/Three.js to create something that for now I can only image. I would like to create a website for visitors to have a transcendental experience where they would navigate to 4 different spaces inspired by the basic elements: air, water, fire and earth. I haven’t used any of these tools before, but I’m hopeful that I can make it happen.
