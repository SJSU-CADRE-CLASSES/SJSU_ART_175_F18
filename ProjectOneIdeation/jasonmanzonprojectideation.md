For my project ideation I wanted to create a 3D earth/world in space where one side of the sphere depicted a clean healthy environment and if one were to scroll/click to the other side of the world shows a trashed dark and gray world with audio that matches the contrasting atmosphere. The concept behind this idea is that our world can see two futures depending on how well we treat our environment and keep it clean. There are a lot of waste that goes everywhere, especially in the ocean and it's harming our environment.
