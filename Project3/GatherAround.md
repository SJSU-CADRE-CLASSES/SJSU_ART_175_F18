The project ‘Gather Around’ is a interactive project about the awareness of mental health.
The term ‘anxiety’ is commonly used by the internet users as a joke and it’s taken lightly which can be very misleading.
  
  This interactive project offers experiences to help people understand what it's like to have anxiety in public places.
