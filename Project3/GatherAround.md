The project ‘Gather Around’ is a interactive project about the awareness of mental health.
The term ‘anxiety’ is commonly used by the internet users as a joke and it’s taken lightly which can be very misleading.
  
  This interactive project offers experiences to help people understand what it's like to have anxiety in public places. 
  When you start the experiment, the webiste choses randomly 
  
  
  Calvin: Came up with the idea for the website, planned the webiste, wrote the discussion questions Lastly, Created CSS and added sounds. 
  Christian: Created the wireframe for the website and wrote HTML codes.
