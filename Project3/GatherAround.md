The project ‘Gather Around’ is a interactive project about the awareness of mental health.
The term ‘anxiety’ is commonly used by the internet users as a joke and it’s taken lightly which can be very misleading.
  
  This interactive project offers experiences to help people understand what it's like to have anxiety in public places. 
  When you start the experiment, the webiste choses randomly between regular discussion pages and anxiety discussion pages. According to researches, anxiety makes the person to often mix up the words and to provide the similar expeirence, the anxiety discussion pages limit the word uses. Also the anxiety discussion page automatically plays a raising heartbeat sound to create more anxious enviornment.
  
  
  Calvin: Came up with the idea for the website, planned the webiste, wrote the discussion questions Lastly, Created CSS and added sounds. 
  
  Christian: Created the wireframe for the website and wrote HTML codes. Also created the base layout and flow of the website in HTML.
