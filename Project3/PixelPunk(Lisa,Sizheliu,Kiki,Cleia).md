## Chapter1
You know the slices of me<br>
Every movement, gesture, behaviour<br>
Might change the results of how you perceive me<br>
It's so real, but not the entire story.

## Chapter 2
The true self is always shifting.<br>
We learn to adapt well to a new environment, or we have to.<br>

It gets hader to perceive our unique identity

The camera represents how others look at you, the sketches are like filters. When people look at someone they see only what they want to see and not who you truly are. 

Shifting identities to better adapt to a new environment - Trying to be everywhere to better fit, living in virtual and physical environments.

Also, inspired by <b>Do Ho Suh, Who Am We?, 1999</b>
