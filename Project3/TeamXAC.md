Our project intends to explore how networks can be used to allow artists to collaborate and collect their ideas into a single place. Using node the viewer can open the files locally and draw on the white canvas. This data is then transferred onto an online website where all of the data from the local servers are collected and unify them onto a single canvas where a new work of art will be created.
