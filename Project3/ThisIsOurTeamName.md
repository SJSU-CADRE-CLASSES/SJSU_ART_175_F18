For our project, we decided to create a chrome extension; a url redirector focused on switching news outlets online. Presently, especially now within our current political climate, the US population have become more split than ever before. A lot of news outlets are serving only to confirm other people’s pre-existing beliefs; telling people what they want to hear. These outlets tell the same story but twist their words to fit their agenda. In this extension, we made it so that websites focusing on more liberal or more conservative views were switched. The extension works when someone is searching certain political website keywords.  For example, if someone on the right were to type “fox news” on the search, they would be redirected to an equally biased website from the left. This would be the same for someone with a liberal stance. Most websites that are fairly neutral or more balance in their reports would be untouched. We did this because we believe it would be a nice change for people to get out of their political bubble or move to more trustworthy websites.

Kohl: worked on basic research; got the base code together(and recieved the most pain) and provided some of the code for search keywords to be redirected(both ways, and fairly neutrals to better ones).  

Tiffany: worked on basic research; worked on majority of the code for redirecting conservative keywords to liberal websites; uploading/publishing the extension.
