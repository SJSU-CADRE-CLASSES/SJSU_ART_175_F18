<p> Our idea is about to make a kind of cultural critique to what social network is doing to human, and it was inspired by the reading "Pretend to Be A bot" that we have read in this class. As we all know, some places like Google, are collecting the data from the users, they are having everything that you have seen on the website, in this case, some people clear up the cookie after they use. However, the chatbot gets more and more popular right now, and people are providing the information to chat with the bot, as well as while people are using Google, and they type and search the information that they are looking for, then Google tells them the answer . Well, unlike Google, you are not able to delete what you have sent out in the chat room. So, we are thinking to create a chatbot on website with certain scenario that show people specific narratives(or scene).</p>
