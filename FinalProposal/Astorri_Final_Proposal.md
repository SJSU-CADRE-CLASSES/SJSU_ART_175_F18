Anthony Astorri – Final Proposal 

The year 2018 has been a very long one indeed, with memes coming and going throughout the year. So much has happened, culture has not been able to keep up. Things people enjoyed at the beginning of the year, have simply been forgotten as we approach the end. Some have even forgotten the Winter Olympics even occurred this past January, myself included. The goal of this project is to bring light to this subject, and to help remember what we have forgotten.
