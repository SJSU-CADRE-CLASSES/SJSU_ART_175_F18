For my final project I am planning on writting a story in the form of letters. The conversation with be going back and forth through a human and an AI discussing certain topics such as emotions, politics, and asking the AI it's thoughts on the future ect. Will be using a real life experiment with Replika AI for examples to help with the story line and questions.
