Hito Steyerl introduction with the strange contemporary technology: a crystal orb representing the world. She makes a connection to the VR googles, and the teleportation feeling that can inhabit a scene in the body. The explanation was presented alongside a example video of facebooks VR development in Puerto Rico, which was interesting to think about when thinking about the painting. The VR universe consists of everything besides the body in place, examples of how these kind of environments are within the bubble of our own reality through media outlets, crafting and narrating our own realities. The bubble and 360 technologies question whether humans will be in the middle of a future that not longer needs them. Steyerl gave many interesting ideas behind the many bubble theories and possibilities.
