Listening to Hito Sheyerl’s lecture on  virtual reality opens a new perspective in which offers a different experience from what is real and what is artificial. Virtual reality allows the user to not only feel as though they are in a virtual environment but allows for that virtual environment to be manipulated to any setting the user or player wants to be placed in. Throughout Sheyerl’s lecture she mentions what she calls bubble vision in which humans view through spheres or round lense and can view in a 360 degree view. The “bubbles” that she also describes in the lecture can represent human aspects such as what we face through in daily lives like finance and money and these bubbles won’t disappear but break down into smaller bubbles. But as humans, we are able to control these bubbles more or less the environment that we live in and that ties along together with virtual reality in which we can even escape from actual reality and away from those bubbles. Virtual reality gives us control and freedom to create any environment and be placed in them easily. Another metaphor that she uses bubbles as are different worlds and how these bubbles may or may not be real.
