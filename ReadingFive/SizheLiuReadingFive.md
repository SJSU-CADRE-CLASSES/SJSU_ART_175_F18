<p>Hito Steyerl introduced the "Bubble Vision"，She started with an image of “Salvator Mundi" that painted by Leonardo da Vinci, and extended to the point that the ball is kind of giving people an virtual space. So she gave us a thought that imaging the bubble is Facebook in 360 degree virsion, and when you click it, you will get into the Facebook page. It is interesting and I like this idea about you go online in 360 vision even Steyerl just randomly mentioned it. I feel like it means more when you can really go into the Facebook. Because it is a data world, according to what we read before, Facebook thing is all about data collecting. So walking into the inner world is more like recognization of reality. Also, she mentioned that the clear bubble in Jesus' hand was logically painted in a wrong way because the world in the orb is not upside down and she thought daVinci did this in purpose. I believe this is a reflection to our human life: as the orb stands for virtual reality world, the internet, people always try to believe what they want to believe on the internet and sometimes hide the truth so that the reality is regarded as the sham, and the false becomes the truth.</p>
