In this video, Hito Steryl discusses the concept of Bubble Vision. It is a talk regarding virtual reality and its recent developments. 
In the real world, we move around physically. In virtual reality, its users are placed in the center of the universe. Everything revolves
and moves around the user. Steryl shows a demo video featuring Mark Zuckerberg. In the demo video, Zuckerberg’s avatar, along with his 
social VR chief, Rachel Franklin, are placed in a new virtual reality platform, Facebook Spaces. This space allows the two to communicate
with one another in this virtual environment. The demo also features these spheres which act like portals to certain places and events.
Mark uses the first to warp to Puerto Rico during a flood. They are able to look around in the 360 environments. It gives them the
illusion that they are physically in that place, despite just being in a virtual environment. They comment how it feels real, how their
avatar’s eye contact feels genuine and are able to perform actions such as high-fives. Throughout most of the video, Steryl shows several
artworks of bubbles, spheres, crystal balls, and orbs. They all tie to the idea of virtual reality and how its users become the bodiless 
center. The viewer is central, yet since it is all virtual, their bodies are missing from the scene. Virtual reality is a really
interesting space because of this. It allows you to be in places you normally couldn’t. You voluntarily place yourself in this space.
It is all an illusion, but with technology continually advancing, an illusion that becomes closer to reality.
