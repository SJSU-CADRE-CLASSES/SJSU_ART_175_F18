How democratic is the internet in post-internet art education? Is the main question of the collaborative essay. This spoke to another question of how proximity is important when it comes to the conversation of post-internet art education. Many of the responses touched on the topic of the co-existence of reality and the internet, and mostly in a negative way. It is clear from most responses that as much as we love and use the internet whether, for personal reasons, social media, or art, we have a love-hate relationship with it. When it came to the topic of democracy in post-internet art education, one response stated that there is no democracy. They stated that “The most challenge for Art Educators now is how to make in a post-internet time the students paying attention and dialogue in an emancipatory bridging the teaching/learning Art at any education level?”.   Could have been worded a little differently, but they make a good point of how it’s difficult and put a lot of pressure on the art educators to make this post-internet art education interesting enough for students. How do you combine these in a way that students want to pay attention and learn from this can be a difficult task? Of the responses I read, democracy wasn’t brought up exactly in the way I thought it would but there were a lot of good discussions on the post-internet art and how art educators have a large part in it.
