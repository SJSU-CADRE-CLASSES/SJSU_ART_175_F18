“How democratic is the internet in post-internet art education?” is a collaborative essay where that prompt was asked and several 
students responded to it below the document. Democracy is a system of government where the people choose their leaders by voting for
them in elections. The essay states that the internet is a tool for democracy. Since it is not a government system, democracy is different
in the context of the internet. Instead, the internet is an opportunity for people to influence the thoughts and decisions of others. 
Artists and writers can inspire thousands of others. However, others can use the internet for nefarious purposes, such as to deceive 
others. With the internet, artists have the opportunity to make their artwork public. Again, this has its drawbacks, since anyone can 
post their work online, including a lot of trash. The internet can be a democracy in ways where its users can vote on certain things,
such as polls, likes, dislikes, upvotes, and downvotes. It gives its users to comment and give their opinions on issues and artworks.
Artists just need to be aware of their ability to influence and inspire others, especially on the connection between the virtual and real
worlds.
