How Democratic is the Internet in Post-Internet Art Education? 

After reading the question and a few responses in the google doc, there was a few responses that reached out to me were from Angeles Saura, Pataky Gabriella, and Ryan Shin. First, my stance is that the internet aids democracy because of how much freedom and inspiration a user can draw from it, especially in post-art internet art education. Saura stated that “the existence of democracy implies the existence of freedom and equality in a framework of rights and duties. We are free to learn and enjoy, all equally”. I agree with her statement because although the internet is free to learn and enjoy, there are others who try to manipulate and deceive people through the internet. The internet allows everyone to enjoy and learn about art and education, but on their own accord. Pataky Gabriella also pointed out that the democracy of the internet leads to the evolution of a fighting manifestation in which the copying of the common place is selective towards development. Especially in the case of the younger generation, solutions come up through imitation. Finally, Ryan Shin stated that “beyond social networking, the internet offers new tools to create expressive spaces”. Shin believes that social networking an 3D virtual reality are very expressive and invites creativity, allowing an open space in which they can share ideas, views and information from the real world virtually.
