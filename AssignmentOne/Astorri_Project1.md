DO COMPUTERS DREAM OF MEMES?

I have always been fascinated by the idea of computers being able to “think” while we are not using them. Inspired by the movie Toy Story, I thought of the notion “does our computer think about what we search up on the internet?” Memes were the first thing that popped into my mind, and I immediately got to work. I followed a tutorial by The Coding Train on Youtube, who gave an in-depth tutorial on how to make a firework like object in P5JS. Instead of making the firework explode, I made a random meme image pop up via an array to almost mimic a thought bubble. I had an addition to the website which was another meme page dedicated to Nicolas Cage, but to my dismay it was on another hard drive not available to me at this current time. This addition will be made tonight.
