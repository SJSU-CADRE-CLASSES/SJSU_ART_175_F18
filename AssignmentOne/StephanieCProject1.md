For this project, I decided to focus on a common and personal topic that I tend to explore in mot of my works. The piece displays a simple website surrounding the a very prevalent social issue that occurs in many people's lives. Depression and anxiety are both serious problems that most individual deal with behind closed downs. Some seek help. Others don't. The ones that don't really do wish for help, a escape; anything to ease their minds. However, many are too afraid and thus keep silent. Friends of mine and even myself, have dealt with these feelings, and we usually escape to our safe spaces to be alone. Most of the time, that would be our bedrooms. Where we can be ourselves privately. Where we are let to think. However, they are the places where we are most alone. Where we allow those intrusive thoughts to fester. This piece follows one of these individuals, and the user can have a little glimpse; a window to their world. Some elements are hidden within some of the pages if the user looks carefully.
