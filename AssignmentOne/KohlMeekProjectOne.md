There's a short story, "I have no mouth but I must scream" written in the 60's by one Harlan Ellison. In it an A.I. brings humanity nearly to extinction as an act of vengeance for us bringing it into its own tortuous existence.This has always been a striking idea to me. What would happen if an artificial intelligence did form a essentially a human mind with no body and in complete sensory deprivation. Surely it would be maddening. In this piece which I call "the clingy webpage" I take a brief look at this idea, but play it for humorous effect in recognition of how frankly absurd the concept is.
