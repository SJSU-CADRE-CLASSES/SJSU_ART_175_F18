Omnipresent explores the idea of reapproaching platforms, like YouTube, that are available to us. In recent years YouTube has allowed users to go live giving the themselves and viewers alike the opportunity to interact. The videos I chose for this project are a little less intimate. With the "fourth wall" in mind I imagine being able to view an audience but them not being able to see me in a less intimate way. Omnipresent also explores the idea of intimacy with live videos of church goers and temple attendees . In those moments of prayer or any religious act really we become vulnerable to what we believe is Omnipresent.
