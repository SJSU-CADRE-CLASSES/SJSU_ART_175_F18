The story behind my project has to do with the serious issue of antidepressant and psychiatric pills that are given and prescribed to young teens and even young adults without even needing to be properly diagnosed. These medicines have serious harmful effects on the mind, body, and can stunt both emotional and social growth. The first page of my project is meant to represent the romanticism of these mental illness pills mostly marketed by pharmaceutical companies to parents who are desperate to “fix” their children. The second page shows the aftermath of how most of these medications cause even more depression and can cause suicidal thoughts in people are were not already suicidal. The aesthetic is meant to be that similar to Tumblr or blog type styles which I thought best correlated with the young teen/ young adult audience that the project is geared towards.
