The concept behind my project integrates a dialogue of my first memorable experience with digital media technology (gameboy) and a maze that was inspired by the game Pokemon. I wanted to create a online realm that stores memories close to me and have others utilize memory to navigate to the end. The user is given a set of portals and must navigate their way to the end using memorization. I incorporated some some interactive elements that may or may not help the user. All together, there are anywhere from 5-10 pages(?) in this maze. This aesthetic is supposed to be similar to those who have played gameboy games, adapting it in a new way that isnâ€™t quite emulated the same way.
