My project is a simple, abridged representation of a chunk of my life. I could only speak and understand Cantonese going into kindergarten (since my parents never taught me English) and as aware of the language and culture as I could be at the time. 
I was enrolled into Chinese school to learn Mandarin at this same time, yet I learned English much faster and retained it a lot more. I began to gradually use Chinese less and eventually decided to drop out of Chinese school because I felt like I could do other things with my time. I spent more time watching TV, listening to music, and doing lots of things that kids my age were doing.
I always thought that since I was born into the culture and was taught the language first that I wouldn't ever be able to forget any of it. I thought that it was like this secret weapon that I could use at any time.
